## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Ultra Code Manager Enhanced, please report it responsibly:

### 🚨 Security Contact

- **Email**: security@ultra-code-manager.dev
- **PGP Key**: [Download our PGP key](https://ultra-code-manager.dev/pgp-key.asc)
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Detailed description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** assessment
4. **Affected versions** and components
5. **Your contact information**
6. **Proof of concept** (if safe to share)

### 🔒 Security Considerations

#### File System Access
- Ultra Code Manager operates with file system permissions of the running user
- Always run with **minimal required permissions**
- Avoid running as root/administrator unless absolutely necessary
- Use containerization (Docker) for additional isolation

#### Path Traversal Protection
- All file paths are normalized and validated
- Relative paths are resolved to absolute paths
- Directory traversal attempts (../../../) are blocked
- Symlink attacks are mitigated

#### Input Validation
- All MCP requests are validated against JSON schema
- File paths are sanitized and checked
- Content size limits are enforced
- Malicious patterns are filtered

#### C++ Assembler Security
- Buffer overflow protection enabled
- Input validation for all operations
- Safe string handling practices
- Memory bounds checking

#### Python Embeddings Security
- Dependencies are regularly audited
- Model files are validated before loading
- Pickle files are not accepted from untrusted sources
- Resource limits are enforced

### 🚫 Security Boundaries

#### What Ultra Code Manager Enhanced Does NOT Do
- **Network access**: No outbound network connections
- **User authentication**: Relies on system-level permissions
- **Encryption**: Files are stored in plaintext
- **Sandboxing**: Runs with user privileges

#### Known Limitations
1. **File permissions**: Inherits user's file system permissions
2. **Resource usage**: No built-in resource limiting
3. **Audit logging**: Limited security event logging
4. **Process isolation**: Runs in same process space as MCP client

### 🔧 Security Configuration

#### Recommended Security Settings

```json
{
  "security": {
    "allowedPaths": ["/safe/workspace", "/project/directory"],
    "maxFileSize": 104857600,
    "maxOperationsPerMinute": 1000,
    "enableBackups": true,
    "backupRetentionDays": 7
  }
}
```

#### Docker Security
```dockerfile
# Run as non-root user
USER ultracm

# Read-only root filesystem
docker run --read-only --tmpfs /tmp ultra-code-manager

# Resource limits
docker run --memory=1g --cpus=1.0 ultra-code-manager

# Restricted capabilities
docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=DAC_OVERRIDE ultra-code-manager
```

#### File System Permissions
```bash
# Create dedicated user
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false ultracm

# Restrict file permissions
chmod 750 /path/to/ultra-code-manager
chown ultracm:ultracm /path/to/ultra-code-manager

# Limit workspace access
chmod 755 /workspace
chown ultracm:ultracm /workspace
```

### 🚧 Secure Deployment Practices

#### Production Environment
1. **Principle of least privilege**: Run with minimal permissions
2. **Network isolation**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
3. **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies and system updated
4. **Monitoring**: Log and monitor file operations
5. **Backup strategy**: Regular backups with integrity checking

#### Development Environment
1. **Isolated development**: Use containers or VMs
2. **Code review**: All changes reviewed for security implications
3. **Dependency scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans
4. **Secrets management**: No hardcoded credentials

### 📊 Security Audit

#### Regular Security Checks
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: `npm audit`, `safety check`
- **Code analysis**: Static analysis tools
- **Penetration testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Compliance checks**: Security policy adherence

#### Automated Security
```yaml
# GitHub Actions security workflow
- name: Security Audit
  run: |
    npm audit --audit-level high
    pip install safety && safety check
    semgrep --config=auto
```

### 🚨 Incident Response

#### In Case of Security Breach
1. **Immediate containment**: Stop affected services
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Inform affected users within 72 hours
4. **Remediation**: Deploy fixes and updates
5. **Post-incident review**: Improve security measures

#### Emergency Contacts
- **Security Team**: security@ultra-code-manager.dev
- **Incident Response**: incident@ultra-code-manager.dev
- **24/7 Hotline**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX
